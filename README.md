# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using PyTorch ðŸ§ ðŸ“¦

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **PyTorch** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset. It trains a model, evaluates its performance, and provides visualizations of the results.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic yet functional deep learning pipeline using PyTorch. It includes:

- Loading and normalizing image data
- Defining and training a CNN model
- Plotting training and validation accuracy
- Visualizing model predictions on test samples

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The model is a simple Convolutional Neural Network with:

- **Conv2d (3â†’32)** â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPool  
- **Conv2d (32â†’64)** â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPool  
- **Conv2d (64â†’64)** â†’ ReLU  
- Flatten â†’ Fully Connected (64 units) â†’ Output layer (10 units)

Loss Function: `CrossEntropyLoss`  
Optimizer: `Adam`  
Epochs: `10`

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset: CIFAR-10

The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of **60,000 color images (32x32)** across 10 classes:

- `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`
- `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`

The dataset is split into 50,000 training and 10,000 test images. It's automatically downloaded via `torchvision.datasets`.
